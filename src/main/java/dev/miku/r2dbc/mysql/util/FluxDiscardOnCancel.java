/**
 * A decorating operator that replays signals from its source to a {@link DiscardOnCancelSubscriber} and drains the
 * source upon {@link Subscription#cancel() cancel} and drops data signals until termination.
 * Draining data is required to complete a particular request/response window and clear the protocol
 * state as client code expects to start a request/response conversation without any previous
 * response state.
 * <p>
 * This is a slightly altered version of R2DBC SQL Server's implementation:
